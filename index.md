# 1. Introduction 

## 1.1 Project Overview

Shout! is a Bluetooth low energy [BLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) mesh-based messaging application that is supported on Android and iOS. It allows users to talk to other users within a single messaging room as long as they are all connected to the same Bluetooth [mesh](https://www.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-technology/topology-options/le-mesh/mesh-tech).

# 3. Managerial Process
## 3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities
The main objective of this project is to develop an Android and iOS application that uses Bluetooth and Location Services to chat with other users who are also included in the same Bluetooth mesh. By the end of term (August 14, 2018), all project deliverables should be complete, as well as a first draft working version of our application. Having consistent, informative and easy-to-read documentation and smooth project flow is a top priority for this project. Our application relies on our resources and time as there is no budget to this project.

## 3.2 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms 
There will be 2 short progress meetings every Tuesday and Thursday after class. Working meetings for deliverables are to take place on a mutually agreed upon time depending on the organizational structure.
All communication is to take place on Slack, in the appropriate team channels. All time will also be tracked using Google Sheets for documentation and GitHub for code.
Testing and SQA is to be completed as soon as a deliverable is deemed as “ready”. This is to ensure that the team is on track, corrections are being made as mistakes are found and everything is moving along smoothly according to the requirements.
